    "#### BlackJack Card Game:\n",
    "<p>Blackjack is a popular casino card game that combines strategy and luck. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it, while also beating the dealer's hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Basic Rules</b><br>\n",
    "<b>Players and Dealer:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blackjack is typically played between a dealer and one or more players.\n",
    "- Each player competes against the dealer, not against other players.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Card Values:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number cards (2–10) are worth their face value.\n",
    "- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.\n",
    "- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the hand most.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The Deal:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each player and the dealer receive two cards.\n",
    "- Players' cards are dealt face-up.\n",
    "- The dealer has one card face-up and one face-down (the \"hole card\").\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Gameplay:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players decide how to play their hand, aiming for a total value as close to 21 as possible.\n",
    "- If a player's total exceeds 21, they \"bust\" and lose the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Player Options:</b>\n",
    "- Hit: Take another card to increase the hand value.\n",
    "- Stand: Keep the current hand and end the turn.\n",
    "- Double Down: Double the initial bet, take exactly one more card, and stand afterward.\n",
    "- Split: If the first two cards are of equal value (e.g., two 8s), they can be split into two separate hands. Each hand gets an additional card, and the player places a second bet equal to the first.\n",
    "- Surrender: Forfeit half the bet and end the round (available in some versions).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dealer Rules:</b>\n",
    "The dealer must follow specific rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hit if their hand value is 16 or less.\n",
    "- Stand if their hand value is 17 or more (in most versions).\n",
    "- The dealer does not make strategic choices; their moves are automatic based on the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Winning Conditions:</b>\n",
    "A player wins if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's.\n",
    "- The dealer busts (exceeds 21) while the player does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Betting:</b>\n",
    "Before the cards are dealt, each player places a bet.\n",
    "Players win or lose based on their hand versus the dealer’s.\n",
    "</p>"
